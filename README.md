# IoT4Ag-Thesis
This thesis addresses powering IoT sensor systems in remote agriculture by designing a solar harvesting and battery charging module with MPPT, achieving up to high efficiency and featuring a Micropython-based real-time data logging system. This system is capable of operating in remote conditions for 2.5 days in zero sun conditions.
